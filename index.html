            <p class= "lead">When Team Foxcatcher split in the early 90’s to focus on the training and development of our
            Senior-level World and Olympic team members, Team Renegade was born. Guided by legendary coaches Dale Bonsall,
            affectionately known as Bonz, and National Wrestling Hall of Fame coach Bruce Kennett, Team Renegade became
            the original elite, invite-only wrestling club in Southeast Pennsylvania. The kids that were fortunate enough
            to be a part of Team Renegade will tell you that it was more than just a club; it was a life-changing experience.
            Kids drove from parts of PA, NJ, MD, and DE and literally lined up out the door for the opportunity to train
            with Team Renegade. If you grew up in Southeast PA in the 90’s, you understand the power and significance of the
            Renegade singlet; it was oftentimes feared and always respected.  To those who donned that logo, the expectations
            were high, but we laid it all on the line each week desiring nothing more than praise from the Bonz Man — there
            was no greater reward in the world.  The truth is that there are no words that can describe what it meant to be a
            part of Team Renegade. Only those who entered that room and stood toe-to-toe with one another understand what it
            means to be a Renegade brat.  So we say thank you and tip our hats to Bonz and Bruce for all that they have done
            and for the lives they shaped.  They changed the coaching paradigm from coach-athlete to a teacher-student dynamic, which is the cornerstone of the Renegade philosophy.</p>
